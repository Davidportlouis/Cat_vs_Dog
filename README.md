![Cat vs Dog](./static/cat_dog.jpeg)

* Organizing Train/Validation data  [Refer preprocess.py](preprocess.py)
* Transfer Learning
* Training and save the model
* Inference using test 

### Important Note
> This model was trained using only 1000 images.

> 500 cat and 500 dog images for training.

> another 250 cat and 250 dog images for validation.

> Trained on intel core i5-4460 w/o cuda.

> Training time for 1 epoch: 483.96 sec {8:30 min:sec}.

> Testing acc: 94% after 1 epoch
